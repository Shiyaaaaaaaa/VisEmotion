## Introduction

The project aims to develop a prototype tool that utilizes sentiment analysis from existing machine learning (ML) models to extract emotional information and visualize the results. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly system. This system not only presents the extracted emotional data alongside ML results but also assists users in collecting emotion-related information and visualization. By providing concrete visual representations, the tool enables a better understanding of the abstract world of emotions. This, in turn, helps healthcare professionals comprehend the emotional states of their patients and aids family members and friends in understanding othersâ€™ emotions. Ultimately, the tool facilitates improved treatment and support for individuals to understand emotions.

## Prototype Overview

This project consists of both frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: The frontend code is located in the `emotionSpace` folder. To access the frontend interface, open any HTML file in this folder. The title page of the project is set to `emotionBox.html`, which can be opened first for navigation.

- **Backend**: The backend code resides in the `sentiment` folder. Refer to the `readme.md` document in this folder for instructions on installing necessary libraries and running the backend interface.


## Project Objectives

The project aims to develop a prototype system capable of collecting user data, extracting underlying emotional information, and providing output and visualization tools for relevant stakeholders. It is important to note that the system will not involve the collection of real users' private data due to ethical issues but will serve as a prototype for demonstration purposes.
